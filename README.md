MFA Death
======
MFA Death is one of a kind when it comes to security research tools on Android, 
only designed for an example of Invisidroid usage scenarios.. it is now
a powerful tool of it's own - deserving of its own repo.

What is Invisidroid ?
Invisidroid has been inspired by hidden applications on Android,    
the concept was to break the difficulty in building your own Hidden     
applications for Android.    

Hidden applications are not launched by the App Launcher but by calling     
a secret number in your dialer.    

Usually ghis is a cumbersome and annoying process with changing API's but     
i have built this to work for Android 9 and still not need the     
permission acceptance for everything.    
 
This application is specifically for Security Research development and     
education, however considering i have released it under MIT license terms     
you are free to modify and distribute it as you wish.
