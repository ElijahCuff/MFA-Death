MFA Death
======
MFA Death is the first of a kind when it comes to security research tools on Android, 
only designed for an example of Invisidroid usage scenarios.. it is now
a powerful tool of it's own - deserving of its own repo.

This application was designed strictly for security education only,
DO NOT INSTALL ON UNAUTHORISED DEVICES.

MFA Death is a hidden application that replicates the victim devices MFA,
Multi Factor Authentication codes and sends them to the installer.

## Using Information correctly ( method disclosed )    
‚Ä¢ Keno games draw 20/80 numbers, that's 1/4 chances for every single number on the board.         
‚Ä¢ A single number "One Spot" costs $1 and Pays $3, that's a $1 profit.      
‚Ä¢ A single number "One Spot" has a 1/4 chance of winning.   
‚Ä¢ Let's do some math,          
    
Because the game pays $3 over a $1 bet, that means we can use a famous method by secret gamblers to always come out with profit.     
  
The famous method is to increase your bet amount, so much that the total cost of all your games will be less than the win amount if the game was to win - meaning the profit outweighs the total cost.     
   
How can you do that  ?    
‚Ä¢ Several methods in existence work, but most methods are based on Arbitrage betting,    
 Let's say that you're flipping a coin for $1 and the win amount is $3 - Arbitrage betting is when you bet $1 on heads and $1 on tails - always walking away with the bookys money.     
 
This (simplistic example) method is called - Arbitrage Betting.     
   
We have a few ways when studying the KENO system in Australia to outwit the random system.      
   
A am not a math wizard, so please bare with me....    
  
Here is Method 1 : the simplist way i could explain it.     
  
### METHOD 1    
DOUBLE ME BABY !!!            
This method requires you to double your bet every time you lose the game of 1 Spot with 1/4 chance.       

GAME : BET COST : WIN RESULT : WIN AMOUNT : TOTAL COST : PROFIT    
>  1 : $1 : üëé : $0 : -$1 : +$0       
>  2 : $2 : üëé : $0 : -$3 : +$0    
>  3 : $4 : üëé : $0 : -$7 : +$0       
>  4 : $8 : üëç : $24 : -$15 : +$9    
   
After losing 3 games and winning 1 game, using the double bet method allows you to always come out on top ( defeating the system ) - but be careful, doubling your bet over 21 times is more that 1 million dollars..             
       
   
### METHOD 2    
I LOVE THAT EVENS !!!           
This method requires you to keep betting on EVENS until you get a win, using the doubling method.   
   
( SAME CHART AS ABOVE )   

### HOW DOES THIS WORK ?     
‚Ä¢ We are reducing the game to a simple WIN or LOSE scenario - A WIM or LOSE scenario is the same as Heads or Tails     
‚Ä¢ Here we have reduced the game to apply Arbitrage Betting on the simplified game.
